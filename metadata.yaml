description: "Eight Cousins, or The Aunt-Hill was published in 1875 by American novelist\
  \ Louisa May Alcott. It is the story of Rose Campbell, a lonely and sickly girl\
  \ who has been recently orphaned and must now reside with her maiden great aunts,\
  \ the matriarchs of her wealthy Boston family. When Rose's guardian, Uncle Alec,\
  \ returns from abroad, he takes over her care. Through his unorthodox theories about\
  \ child-rearing, she becomes happier and healthier while finding her place in her\
  \ family of seven boy cousins and numerous aunts and uncles. She also makes friends\
  \ with Phebe, her aunts' young housemaid, whose cheerful attitude in the face of\
  \ poverty helps Rose to understand and value her own good fortune.\n From Wikipedia\
